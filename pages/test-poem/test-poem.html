        <h1>The poem</h1>

        <pre>
            There sleeps a poem in my mind
                That shall my entire soul express.
            I feel it vague as sound and wind
                Yet sculptured in full definiteness.
     
    
            It has no stanza, verse or word.
                Ev'n as l dream it, it is not.
            'Tis a mere feeling of it, blurred,
                And but a happy mist round thought.
    
     
            Day and night in my mystery
                I dream and read and spell it over,
            And ever round words' brink in me
                Its vague completeness seems to hover.
    
    
            I know it never shall be writ.
                I know I know not what it is.
            But I am happy dreaming it,
                And false bliss, although false, is bliss.</pre>
